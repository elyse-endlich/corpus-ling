# Hello! Welcome to my Corpus Linguistics repository.
This is where I keep all my projects from my first corpus linguistics class, which I took in the spring of 2020.

I've cleaned up my code for showcasing, but since this was an intro class, _a lot of it has issues!_
Since this class, I've learned how to **write cleaner code**, how to **better automate my code**, 
and how to **limit the amount of stress I put my computer under**.
I still think it's important to show where I started, though!

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
